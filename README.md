# example_mastercaster
The scripts used in the Master Caster project.

The scripts folder is presented as organised in Unity itself and contains every script written for the project. Each script is annotated with comments throughout.

Please note that as this is an older project, code standards may not be up to date with newer projects like the Super Mario remake.
